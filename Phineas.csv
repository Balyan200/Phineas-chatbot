Phineas," I'll be honest, Ferb. I'm having a hard time putting a positive spin on this. But, I guess that's life, huh? One minute you're having the best day ever, the next you're being fed to a monster the size of a two car garage."
Doofenshmirtz," Yeah? Well, welcome to my life! (the Goozim roars, he gasps and hides behind a robot)"
Phineas, Huh. And everything started out so well this morning. (Ferb looks at the screen)
 The Phineas and Ferb," Across the Second Dimension logo fades in, and shortly after its tagline, ""In Fabulous 2D"", pops in.)"
Phineas," Good morning, Perry! Now that's the way to wake up. (He hugs Perry) This is gonna be the best day ever."
Song, Everything's Better with Perry)
Lawrence," Good morning, boys."
Linda," Happy anniversary, Perry."
Phineas," Oh, that's right! Gosh, I can't believe it's been five years. I remember the day we first got you."
Lawrence," Come on, kids. Pick out any pet you want."
Linda," Oh look, Phineas! This one's looking at you! (picks up Phineas and shows him a cat)"
Lawrence," And this one's looking at you, Ferb! (picks up Ferb and shows him a dog)"
Young Candace, (walks through the aquarium section and all the fish swim away as she approaches) Why won't anything look at me?!
Young Phineas, Ferb! This one's looking at both of us at the same time!
Linda, Awww...
Young Candace," That thing?! You're kidding, right?"
Store employee, Is there something I can do for you?
Lawrence," Ah, yes, we'd like that one, please."
Store employee, (surprised) You'd like to adopt a platypus?
Lawrence," Oh, is that what it is? Well, yes! May we have him please?"
Store employee, Okay.
Young Candace, What would you even name a platypus?
Phineas," (Narrating) 'Course, Ferb and I knew exactly what to call you."
Young Phineas and Ferb, (simultaneously) Bartholomew!
Phineas," And then when we got you home, we renamed you Perry. And gave you this locket!"
Candace," (in her room, talking with her cell phone) Hey, Jeremy. You wanna go to the mall?"
Jeremy," (At his house) You know, I'd love to, but my dad is taking me to check out his old college today."
Jack Johnson, (runs in) Boo-ya! Go Polecats! Boo-ya! (he runs away)
Jeremy, He's already set up an interview with the academic adviser. Can you believe that?
Candace," Gee, Jeremy. I forgot you're a whole year older than me. A trip to college? Heh-heh.. That's, that's really great. Okay, well, I'll talk to you later. Bye. (Hangs up phone and picks up a stuffed teddy bear with a picture of Jeremy taped to its face)"
Phineas," (holding a baseball bat and tapping the home plate) All right, looks like the pitcher's ready, and...batter up!"
Isabella," (enters) Hi, Phineas! What'cha doin'?"
Phineas, Turning Perry's involuntary reflex into sporting event.
Isabella," Hi, Perry! Can I try? (scratches Perry's neck and the baseball is catapulted out of the yard)"
Phineas," Whoa, mama! Nice shot, Isabella!"
Baljeet, (enters along with Buford) Did someone lose a ball?
Phineas," Yeah, we were just playing platypult."
Baljeet," Oh, I love Platypus-themed sports! (Buford looks slightly annoyed at this)"
Phineas," You know, if we had two Perrys, we could put a net between them and play platypult badminton!"
Buford, Who's Annette?
Phineas," Ferb, that's it! I know what we're gonna do today!"
Buford," No, seriously. Who's Annette?"
Phineas," Okay, everyone. I think the tail is all set. I'll just go check with the foreman."
Isabella, (noticing Perry's absence) He's gone!
Phineas," Hey, where's Perry? (he checks under the machine) Did he really slip away? On his anniversary? Sometimes it seems like Perry's missed every single cool thing we've done all summer long. I guess he can do whatever he wants. After all, it's HIS day, right?"
Baljeet," Hey, what was the small noise?"
Phineas, Let's all go walk over to it!
Major Monogram," Ah, good morning, Agent P. Uh, quick word. Recently you've been having some close calls, and your host family has nearly caught you sneaking into your lair several times. No need to remind you, but I'll do it anyway, that if your cover's blown, you'll have to be transferred to another city, with another host family. (Perry looks unamused) And we both know you wouldn't like that. (chuckles) I remember the day you were first assigned."
Female store employee, Enjoy your platypus!
Lawrence, Thank you! Cheerio!
Younger Carl," (into a headset) Agent assignment complete, sir."
Younger Monogram," (inside a computer-filled room) Good job, Carl! If you keep up the great work, you'll make unpaid intern in no time!"
Carl, (off screen) And I did!
Major Monogram," Don't get cocky, Carl! Agent P, as you know, every operative is equipped with an auto-scan replication device, just like the one in your hat. We've been using the information you've gathered to replicate each and every one of Dr. Doofenshmirtz's inators. Our top men have been analyzing them to determine if they've been getting smarter or dumber. And, to be honest, the jury's still out. Now we find out that he's in the process of building an alternate dimension-related inator. Your assignment is to stop him, before he finishes building it. Behind you, rising dramatically from the floor, is Carl with some high-tech devices that you might find useful."
Carl," (off-screen) Um, Sir? Hello? I didn't step on in time. Would you mind lowering the platform again?"
Major Monogram," Oh, great, let me... cue the music again. (Rewind dramatic music and plays it again as Carl rises with the platform this time)"
Carl," Voilà, monsieur! (He shows a wristwatch) This first item is our new wrist-communicationizer. It has many applications that will help you in the field. For example, a powerful directional electro-magnet. It will draw any metal object to you. (He pushes a button and his glasses are drawn to it) See? And these are aluminum!"
Major Monogram," Quit goofing around, Carl, and show him the hologram."
Carl," Yes, sir. (he pushes a button on the watch and turns on hologram of Major Monogram)"
Major Monogram," Hehe. Pretty nifty, huh? (from the hologram) With this device, you'll be able to contact me anywhere at anytime, but don't call between 3:30 and 4:00, because...that's when I take a shower. Whoa wee, wait a minute. (Points to Monogram on the big screen) Is that... me?"
Carl," Oh, no! His holographic projection has become mesmerized by his video image! I better shut it off."
Stacy," (enters) Hey, girl. Uh, what are you doing?"
Candace," Stacy, Jeremy's going to college soon, and here I am concerned with busting my brothers to my mommy and living in this NURSERY. (She picks up a ceramic unicorn) A unicorn! A UNICORN, Stacy! (mockingly) ""Hi, I'm six!"" You've GOTTA help me get rid of all this junk."
Stacy," Wow, bold move!"
Candace," Yep! Goodbye, childhood folly. Hello, carefree, undemanding, adult life!"
Linda," (enters) Yeah, good luck with that. Candace, your father and I are off to the movies. While we're gone, you're in charge, okay?"
Candace," Okay, Mom! (to Stacy) And you know, I'm even thinking of giving up on busting my brothers."
Stacy," The irony is, that as a grown up, you don't NEED to tell your mom. You can just bust them yourself."
Candace," (gasps) That's it! Stacy, I'm old enough to bust them myself!"
Stacy, That's what I just said.
Doofenshmirtz," Now, Perry the Platypus, quake in terror, as I punch a hole through to another dimension! (shows his Other Dimensionator) Behold! The Other-Dimensionator..."
Norm, Sir!
Doofenshmirtz, What? What?
Norm, (in front of a large buffet table) I've finished setting up the buffet.
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, for crying out loud, Norm. I was in the zone!"
Norm, I just thought you were playing with your doll.
Doofenshmirtz," It's not a doll, it's a stand-in. Pretendy the Practice-pus, see? I wonder if Perry the Platypus practices with a fake me? It would be nice to know he cares enough...(tennis ball eye falls off the stand-in)"
Phineas," All systems are green. Prepare to launch on my mark. T-minus thirty and counting. 29, 28, 27, 26..."
Carl," ...Of course, you'll only need this if you're attacked by one of the royals or a member of Parliament, so it's probably okay to leave the safety on. And here's your brand new rocket-car. (He shows it as Perry gets in and starts it) Sweet huh? Good luck, Agent P!"
Major Monogram," Uh, Carl? Did you tell him the accelerator's a little touchy?"
Carl," I think he knows, sir."
Phineas," ...3, 2, 1, service!"
Candace," Phineas and Ferb, you are so bus... Oh my gosh! Where'd it go? You there! Small children! Where's the big contraption?"
Isabella," I don't know, it was here just a moment ago."
Candace," It disappeared! Stacy, do you realize what this means?"
Stacy, We're done?
Candace," No! Some mysterious force always takes away Phineas and Ferb's inventions before Mom shows up, this time, it took it away before I showed up! The mysterious force recognizes that I'm now a grown-up!"
Stacy," A ""mysterious force""? I'm not buying it. I am a woman of science. At least that's what my horoscope said."
Candace," Well, I'm going to prove it to you and bust my brothers at the same time! Where are my brothers?"
Baljeet, We just launched them toward the park. Buford is there with the other platypult.
Candace," Okay, as the adult, I decree we're going to the park. Does anyone need to go potty first? (awkward pause. Stacy raises her hand) Fine, make it quick."
Phineas, Ferb! It looks like we're going to hit that building that looks vaguely like your head!
Doofenshmirtz," Time to give it a little test. (he turns it on, it starts for a brief second, then shuts down) Hmm. Well, I just finished it. It can't be broken already."
Doofenshmirtz, (sighs) I stand corrected.
Phineas," We're really sorry, sir. I don't know what happened. One minute we were innocently launching ourselves across the city in a badminton platypult, the next thing we know, we're bouncing on up to the east side to your deluxe apartment in the sky."
Doofenshmirtz," Well, it looks like you've totaled my Other-Dimensionator."
Phineas, An Other-Dimensionator? What does it do?
Doofenshmirtz," Well, at the moment, it just stops giant shuttlecocks, apparently, but it's supposed to let me go into other dimensions."
Phineas," Oh, that's cool! We can help you fix it. I'm Phineas and this is my brother, Ferb."
Doofenshmirtz," I'm Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, but my friends call me.... (stops and thinks) I just got into such a funk."
Phineas, Ferb is naturally handy with tools. I'll bet we could put this thing back together again in no time.
Doofenshmirtz," Ah, what the heck. Before we start, there's a whole buffet set up here. Please partake, I was expecting someone who seems to be running late."
Driver," You're lucky I got a rocket car winch, lots of guys don't have that."
Phineas," Almost there. Okay, field compressor attaches to the auxiliary generator. Was this working before?"
Doofenshmirtz," Well, if by ""working"", you mean ""functioning properly"", then, uh, no."
Phineas," Well, I think I see your problem. Everything's wired through this self-destruct button. Do you even need that?"
Doofenshmirtz," Well, of course I need—Wait a minute. No! I do not need that! You are absolutely right. Huh."
Phineas," So Ferb has rigged up this remote control, so that if we get separated from the portal, we can open another one."
Doofenshmirtz," Nice touch, kid."
Phineas," I guess this is the last piece. Okay, Ferb, boost me up. (Ferb lifts him)"
Doofenshmirtz," Ooh, I cannot wait!"
Phineas," Oh, there you are, Perry."
Doofenshmirtz, Perry?
Phineas, Yeah. He's our pet platypus.
Doofenshmirtz, Is every platypus named Perry?
Phineas," In a perfect world, yes."
Doofenshmirtz," Aww, well, he's a cute little fella. Hi there. (he tickles Perry's chin) Gootchie-- (Perry bites his finger) OW OW OW!"
Phineas," Perry, no! (He and Ferb pull him off) We do not bite the elderly!"
Doofenshmirtz," Again, ow. No, it's okay. Platypuses don't typically like me."
Phineas," Well, Perry, you're just in time to see us open a window to another dimension."
Doofenshmirtz," Alright, let's get this show on the road, huh?"
Major Monogram," (his head appears beside Perry) Remember, if your cover's blown, you'll never see the boys again."
Doofenshmirtz," Hey, does anyone hear someone talking?"
Major Monogram, (actually the hologram on Perry's watch) Never see them again...
Phineas," Okay, (Perry walks over to the nearby couch) here we go. (Ferb lifts him) Right in he--"
Phineas," Perry! No! (He and Ferb run over) Not on the sofa! (Ferb picks him up) Oh, I'm sorry, Dr. D. We should take him out."
Doofenshmirtz," No, no. Wait. It'll be all right. (he turns over the cushion) I was planning on replacing this old couch anyway. Now come on, let's light this pop stand, or however it goes."
Doofenshmirtz," Hmm. It's a...it's a couch. That's a bit anti-climatic. I guess it's a nice couch, though."
Phineas, Um...
Doofenshmirtz," (grabs the pink couch and tries to pull it to the portal) Okay, I got it, I got - uh, maybe, hey, you want to give me a hand here?"
Phineas," Whoa, awesome! (He and Ferb, who's still holding Perry, enter the portal) Check it out!"
Doofenshmirtz," (sees the 2nd dimension Monogram) Oh uh, hello. Say, aren't you..."
Phineas, Hey Dr. D! Look at this!
Doofenshmirtz," Hold that thought! (runs over to a balcony and sees Phineas, Ferb, and Perry are looking out)"
Phineas, You're famous here!
s VO, Get off!
Doofenshmirtz," (Reading a blimp) ""Heinz Doofenshmirtz, Your Leader""?"
Doofenshmirtz, Ha ha! Holy Boy! Even the great Francis Monogram's my slave in this dimension!
Doofenshmirtz," Well, I want to meet this other dimension me, where can I find him?"
Doofenshmirtz," Okay, so I just gotta sit here and..."
Gnomes, ♪ Doof Doof Doof♪ / ♪Bask in his glory♪ / ♪Kneel at his feet ♪ /♪ You're in for such a treat♪ / ♪He's Doofenshmirtz!♪
Doofenshmirtz," That was awesome! (He slides up to a desk, a chair turns to reveal 2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz)"
Doofenshmirtz," Yeah, I'm you from another dimension."
Doofenshmirtz," Right back atcha, big guy."
Doofenshmirtz, I suppose so.
Song, Brand New Best Friend)
Doofenshmirtz," Blech, no, that's gross!"

Doofenshmirtz," Oh no. It just sort of sounded like that. Well, I mean, we could. We should!"
Doofenshmirtz, That can be your catchphrase! You're the grumpy one. (Pokes him) Eh?
Phineas," Wow, he's done really well for himself. What do you think, Perry?"
Doofenshmirtz," Yeah? Well obviously YOU did not have to deal with MY nemesis, Perry the Platypus!"
Doofenshmirtz, What is it?
Doofenshmirtz," Wow, you are good!"
Phineas, That was awesome!
Doofenshmirtz," No, man, it's cool. They're with me."
Phineas," Oh, hey, Dr. D. We thought we lost you."
Doofenshmirtz," Hi, fellas! (2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz grabs him) Whoops!"
Doofenshmirtz, This boy's a secret agent?
Doofenshmirtz, The quiet one?
Doofenshmirtz, This plant?
Phineas," Whoa, hey. He's just a platypus. He doesn't do much."
Phineas, Perry!
Doofenshmirtz, Told ya.
Phineas, How are his vitals?
Doofenshmirtz, What?
Phineas, What?
Phineas," Perry?! (Perry looks at both boys, realizing what he’s done)"
Doofenshmirtz, Wait a minute. I-I'm confused. Why does their platypus fight so good?
Doofenshmirtz, What?
Phineas, (looking hurt) Perry? (Perry guiltily averts his eyes)
Phineas, You're a secret agent?!
Phineas, So this is where you disappear to everyday? You come here and fight this guy?
Doofenshmirtz," No, he-he fights me. He doesn't really know this guy."
Phineas, You fight a pharmacist? Why would you even do that?!
Doofenshmirtz," Actually, I'm an evil scientist, but a lot of people are confused by the lab coat."
Phineas," You're evil? He's evil?! (They back up to the window pane) So not only have you been leading a double life this whole time, but you sat there and let us help an evil scientist open an evil portal into an evil dimension, and you did nothing to stop us?!"
Ferb," Well, he did pee on the couch."
Doofenshmirtz," Wait a second, I just realized. That was a conscious choice! You peed on my couch!"
Phineas," No, no, that wasn't enough! That's when you should've put on your little hat! Not now, after we've gone through it into this mess!"
Phineas," I-I'm sorry, I'm just having trouble processing this right now. (Perry hands him a pamphlet) ""So You've Discovered Your Pet is a Secret Agent..."" (throws it away) I don't want your pamphlet!"
Phineas," Uh-oh. (Perry moves them away, Platyborg turns back and flies at them) He's coming back around!"
Phineas," Oh, you have got to be kidding me! (Perry still struggles) Oh, for crying out loud!"
Phineas," All this time, we're like ""He's a platypus, he doesn't do much"". Well, apparently, you do. You... you, you're tangled up in the..."
Normbot, (approaches them) May I please see your papers?
s," Curse you, Perry the Platypus!"
Doofenshmirtz, Jinx! You owe me a soda!
Normbot," Get me, I'm a Georgia O'Keefe painting!"
Driver," 4th and Main. (Platyborg gets off and hands him some money) What? No tip? (Platyborg turns his hand into the mace) Never mind, I'm good. (He drives off, Platyborg looks around)"
Phineas," Looks like they're gone. (Looks at Perry) You're a secret agent?! And you've been living with us this whole time?! Was that evil guy right? Were we just a cover story to you? I mean, were you ever really our pet or part of our family? (Perry looks down, depressed) Well, apparently not, 'cause you didn't trust us enough to tell us. Anyone else around here leading a bizarre double life? (Ferb raises his hand) Put your hand down, Ferb. (Ferb lowers it) You're a secret agent! He's a secret agent! (Ferb puts a hand on Phineas' shoulder) You're right, Ferb. We gotta concentrate on the task at hand. We've got to get back to our dimension, and I don't even know where to start."
Phineas," Wait. I just realized. You could've been cleaning your own litter box this whole time! (Perry shrugs, looking a little embarrassed) Oh, we are not done with this conversation! (They run off)"
Doofenshmirtz, An ordinary platypus.
Doofenshmirtz, (gasps) Perry the Platypus?!
Doofenshmirtz," Alright, Mr. ""Eviler than Thou"", just how did you manage to take over the Tri-State Area, anyway?"
Normbots, We should do lunch sometime! (they revert back to the armored heads)
Doofenshmirtz," Wow. That is scary. I tried that robot thing once, too. I hid the self-destruct button on the bottoms of their feet, so nobody could reach them."
Doofenshmirtz," I think I've said enough. I still don't get it, if we're the same person, why are you so much better at being evil than me?"
Doofenshmirtz, That's... That's it?
Doofenshmirtz," That's your emotionally scarring backstory? That's your great tragedy? Dude, I was raised by ocelots, literally. Disowned by my parents and raised by Central American wildcats, and you're telling me you lost a toy train? That's it? That's all you got? Really? I had to work as a lawn gnome, I was forced to wear hand-me-up girl's clothing, neither of my parents showed up for my birth!"
Doofenshmirtz," Well, I never lost that toy train."
Doofenshmirtz," Great, we can be a team!"
Doofenshmirtz," Wait, was that sarcasm?"
Doofenshmirtz," Yeah, right there, I'm pretty sure that's my voice when I'm being sarcastic."
Candace," Okay, Buford, where are Phineas and Ferb?"
Buford," How should I know? They never showed up for me to return serve. That's considered a forfeit in catapult badminton, so I went to get some Victory Gum."
Buford, A tradition as old as the game itself.
Candace," Don't play with me, young man. Where is the giant platypult they built?"
Buford, I dunno. Seems to have vanished.
Candace," Oh, really? Did you hear that, Stacy? The mysterious force took the platypult away before I, the grown up, could see it."
Stacy," Yeah yeah, I'm sure there's a logical explanation for all of this."
Driver," And they laughed at me for installing a platypult tow rig. Who's laughing now, Wayne?"
Candace," The logical explanation IS the mysterious force. The real question is, why does it care so much about my little brothers? Why doesn't it want them to get busted?"
Buford," Well, why don't you ask it, Kierkegaard? (They stare) What? Existentialist Trading Cards. (Holds up a pack) It came with the gum."
Candace," Wait, he's right! I should just ask it! I'll bet I can reason with it!"
Stacy," Reason with it? Candace, it's a force! That you made up."
Candace," No! I know what I'm talking about, Stacy. Come on! (Pulls her)"
Stacy, Where are we going?
Candace, To my backyard! The heart of the mysterious force!
Baljeet, Would you like to trade two Sartre for a Nietzsche?
Buford, Alright. (He takes the cards and hands the other over)
Baljeet, Sucker!
Phineas," Well, this should be our street. But it sure looks different."
Phineas," Wow. Well, I guess we'd better get inside. (He is about to ring the doorbell when Perry walks up, Phineas looks) You might want to... uh. I-I mean these guys might not know that you're... not really a... you know..."
Phineas, That was weird. Let's find the other us.
Phineas, (walks in) Hey guys!
Phineas," No no, it's not like that. We're you guys from another dimension."
Phineas, Apparently.
Phineas," Uh, Phineas, he's not your Perry. He came with us."
Phineas, Five counting Perry.
Phineas," Boy, your Candace is much less curious about you're up to."
Phineas," Well, it seems like our Candace has spent her entire summer focused on what we're doing."
Phineas, You guys don't have summer? Well that's-that's terrible.
Phineas," What is summer? Man, where do I begin?"
Song, Summer (Where Do We Begin?))
Phineas," [[#ref_{{{1}}}|^]] The days are longer, The nights are shorter, The sun is shining[[#ref_{{{1}}}|^]]"
Ferb, [[#ref_{{{1}}}|^]] It's noticeably warmer[[#ref_{{{1}}}|^]]

Phineas," [[#ref_{{{1}}}|^]] Summer, every single moment is worth its weight in gold[[#ref_{{{1}}}|^]]"

Phineas," You know, I used to think you couldn't spell ""platypus"" without ""us"". (walks back inside)"
Ferb," Well, you can, but it would just be ""Platyp"". (he shuts the door)"
Phineas," Well, I guess if you guys can't help us fix the remote, we could check with Isabella."
Phineas, The girl who lives across the street.
Phineas," Well, it's time you meet her. Come on, you'll like her."
Phineas," Relax. We've been avoiding them all day. If you're really careful, you can... (they stop in front of a Normbot) Okay, we got to be more careful than that."
Normbot, (Norm Head) May I please see your identification?
Phineas, Uh....
Normbot, (switches to Armored Head) Display your travel papers or be destroyed. Display-display...
Phineas," Hey, it's Buford!"
Phineas," We're Candace's brothers, we're going to Isabella's."
Doofenshmirtz," Behold, the Other-Dimensionator! Actually, this is the Other Other-Dimensionator, the Other-Dimensionator is back in the other dimension. (2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz glares) Okay, step 1 is push this button. (pushes it, it powers up) Step 2, stand back in awe! (it starts up, but then shuts down) Awww..."
Doofenshmirtz," (laughs sheepishly) Now that I think about it, uh, those two boys made some modifications to my design which may have allowed it to, you know, to work."
s," Ah, Perry the Platypus!"
Doofenshmirtz, Jinx! You owe me two sodas!
Phineas, Isabella?
Phineas," Uh, no. He and I are from another dimension. We're trying to get back."
Phineas," Well, we didn't mean to come here. Now we can't go back unless we fix this device. (shows the remote)"
Phineas, Baljeet!
Song," Baljeet Explanation) [[#ref_{{{1}}}|^]] If you travel through dimensions, going clockwise makes it easy, going counter-clockwise would take 8 million gigawatt's of energy, overloading the local power grid! [[#ref_{{{1}}}|^]]"

Phineas, We're just trying to get home.
Phineas, Right now? Quantum Physics.
Candace," Oh, great and powerful Mysterious Force. I know you are just trying to protect my brothers, but I am simply just trying to protect them too from their dangerous inventions. Show yourself so that I may reason with you! (nothing happens) Maybe we should build a shrine to it."
Stacy," Candace, that's ridicul-- (the dimensional portal opens up)"
Both, Ah! It's the mysterious force! (hides behind a tree)
Phineas, Ferb! I think we got it! It looks like home!
Stacy, What do we do now?
Candace, I don't know. I can't believe it actually worked.

Phineas, We're not going anywhere without our platypus!
Phineas," I know what I said. I was hurt. But even if it was all an act, he's still a part of the family, and we're not leaving him behind."
Phineas, It doesn't matter. We're going back for him.
Phineas, Fine. Just tell us where Doofenshmirtz keeps his prisoners.
Candace," You know what, Stacy? I'm tired of the mysterious force pushing me around. I'm gonna show it who's boss! (she heads off)"
Stacy, Candace! Wait!
Phineas," Hey, Candace."
Candace," You guys are so... wait, why are there four of you?"
Phineas," Oh, these guys are from this dimen--"
Candace, Are we inside the mysterious force?
Phineas, I'm not sure I understand the question.
Candace, And why is Isabella suddenly fashionable?
Candace," Seriously, where are we?"
Phineas," (pulls Candace) Candace, I'm sure you have a million questions, but right now, we have to save Perry from being turned into a cyborg."
Candace, What?
Phineas, We'll explain on the way.
Candace," (notices 2nd Dimension Candace) Hey, is that me? I look good!"
Candace," Wait, so in this dimension, Perry is a secret agent?"
Phineas," No, in this dimension, he's a cyborg."
Candace," So, where is he an agent?"
Phineas," That would be in our dimension, but we're not in our dimension right now."
Candace," Okay, I'm having trouble processing this."
Phineas, Now I wish I hadn't thrown away that pamphlet.
Candace, And why are we in mine cars?
Candace," So if there's another me, and another them, then there must also be another Jeremy Johnson here, right?"
Candace," Good soldier? That's all you think of him? Don't you think he's dreamy, or cool, or even cute? Tell me at least you think he's cute!"
Candace," Oh... well, I guess, but what do you guys do around here for, you know, fun?"
Candace," Down, down, down, I know. But what about BFF's, or slumber parties, or busting your little brothers?"
Candace," Gee, you make growing up sound like it's a bad thing."
Doofenshmirtz, That's because it's a trap!
Phineas," Perry! We uh, well... well, we uh, came to rescue you! (pause) So far it's not going as well as we'd hoped. We didn't have a lot of time to, you know, plan something elaborate, but we could've, I don't know, created some sort of diversion, just in case... (sighs) Yeah, we could've thought this out more."
Major Monogram," (holograph) I told you, not between 3:30 and 4:00!"
Phineas," (to Candace) Um, can you do that?"
Candace, Well... apparently...
Phineas," (drops the ammo) No, no, no...!"
Stacy," Look, mysterious force. I feel a little awkward talking to you, since I didn't believe in you at first. 'Cause you know, it's crazy, but then I saw you eat my friend, so, I've made a little shrine here. It's...It's nice, there's a banana, and, uh, oh, Mr. Miggins! So, I hope this makes up for the disbelief thing. Are we, uh, are we good?"
Phineas, No.
Phineas, No.
Candace," Can, uh, can I say something? So I think I'm up to date on the whole Perry-agent thing. Strangely, that's the most normal thing that's happened this afternoon... But who exactly is this guy?"
Phineas, No.
Doofenshmirtz, Hey!
Phineas, No!
Phineas, No!
Phineas, How old do you think we are?
Phineas," See, that's just it. Why would we do something that would lead to our own self-destruction?"
Doofenshmirtz," Self-destruction? Self-destruct... Wait, wait! That's it! I remember now! They took out my self-destruct button! (he pulls it out) I don't know why I put it back in, but here, I'll just rewire this, like so, and there! (he clips in a wire and turns it on, it forms a portal) It's working! It's working! It is functioning properly!"
s, Doom!
Doofenshmirtz, Jinx! You owe me THREE sodas!
Doofenshmirtz," What? But, but I'm you!"
Doofenshmirtz," Wow, if I had a nickel for every time I was doomed by a puppet, I'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice, right?"
Candace," I would say so far, adulthood gets a three."
Doofenshmirtz," You know, this may be as good as it gets. (they walk onto a rocky area)"
Doofenshmirtz," Wait, wait, hold the phone. I can be useful. What if you need a kidney? Or a stand-in for boring functions you have to attend, or another kidney?"
Doofenshmirtz," Aw, pooh."
Phineas," I'll be honest, Ferb. I'm having a hard time putting a positive spin on this. Blah blah blah, two-car garage, etcetera, etcetera."
Doofenshmirtz," Yeah, well, welcome to MY life! (The Goozim roars. He hides behind a Normbot.)"
Ferb, Whoa. Déjà vu-ish.
Phineas," Perry, check out that guard! (we see a ring of keys on a hook on his back) Keys!"
Phineas, Cool! (see the Normbot is also being pulled to them) Ah! Look out!
Doofenshmirtz," Ow! Is this the plan? (they fly into the air and over the lava, he screams) Tell me this isn't the plan!"
Normbot, You are tampering with the property of... (he sparks and turns to the Norm head) Let's make omelets!
Doofenshmirtz, Ow! Can you get a little more lift on this thing? I think I just bruised a kidney.
Normbot, My bicycle is missing!
All, Yay! (the door then breaks off and falls down) Awww...
Normbot," It's muffin time, sir."
Phineas, Okay. I see where you're going with this. (They all climb)
Candace, I officially prefer our dimension.
Doofenshmirtz," Uh, this may not be the best time to tell you, but I actually flunked jungle gym in grade school. I just couldn't get the hang of all that climbing and..."
Doofenshmirtz," Oh great, you caught it! Unlock me!"
Candace, Are you even paying attention?
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, that's right. Uh, it can wait. Later."
Normbot," It's muffin time, sir!"
Phineas," Yay, other dimension Candace!"
Phineas, The remote!
Candace," What?! No, no! Don't let go!"
Phineas, Perry! Trust me!
Candace, Two words: La-va! (Perry struggles)
Phineas, Trust me!
Doofenshmirtz," Thanks, Perry the Platypus."
Normbot, Stop where you are. You cannot leave.
nd Normbot," (Norm head) I use aggression to mask my insecurities! (he turns to the armored head and fires, Phineas dodges)"
Phineas," The portal! (he shuts it, the other bots hit the lava and melt)"
Normbot," (melting) (falling into lava) Boy, I could go for a (slightly muffled voice) lemonade!"
Normbot," The portal closed, sir."
Normbot," But it's not muffin time, sir!"
Phineas," Alright, follow me! We're going around clockwise!"
Song, Brand New Reality)
Buford," Alright, how about two Kafka's for your Dostoevsky?"
Baljeet," Stop wasting my time, Buford."
Phineas," Wait, I think this is it."
Isabella, Where have you guys been?
Phineas, This is it.
Baljeet," Uh, why is Perry wearing a hat?"
Phineas, We don't have time to explain. We've got to try and stop an evil d--
Candace, Uh-oh. It's too late!
Old Woman, Oh my!
Normbot," All vehicles must stop. (It grabs a car and throws it, it impacts into a wall)"
Danny," Oh, great. Albuquerque '93 all over again."
Phineas," I wish alternate dimension Candace was here, she took out like thirty of those guys with a lawn gnome."
Major Monogram," Agent P, our agents are being overwhelmed by the sheer number of robots coming into our dimension. You must get to Doof's headquarters and stop him!"
Phineas," Aye aye, sir! We're ready to serve!"
Major Monogram," Oh no, you kids need to go home, where it's safe!"
Phineas," With all due respect, sir, we've been through quite a lot together. We're a team now."
Major Monogram," Nope, far too dangerous. And besides, our insurance won't cover it. Tell 'em, Agent P."
Phineas," Come on, Perry. Let's go kick some robot chassis!"
DEI," Doofenshmirtz runs to the front door. He pats himself down and then pulls on the door. It's locked, he pushes a button on the intercom.)"
 Thompson, Hello?
Doofenshmirtz," Hello, Mrs. Thompson. It's me, Heinz. I think I left my keys in the other dimension. Can you buzz me in?"
 Thompson, Who is this?
Doofenshmirtz," Heinz Doofenshmirtz, your neighbor, for like 12 years."
 Thompson, Who?
Doofenshmirtz, I live in the penthouse. I wear lab coats a lot. Speak with the accent I am currently speaking to you with.
 Thompson, Just like my neighbor upstairs.
Doofenshmirtz," Yes, exactly!"
 Thompson," Oh, he's not home. You'll have to come back later."
Doofenshmirtz," No no, wait... (she hangs up) Aww!"
nd dimension," 2nd Dimension Candace is in a cell, bouncing a ball against a wall)"
st dimension, Stacy is on her knees next to the altar)
Stacy," Oh, mysterious force, you can see I'm really trying here, please bring back Candace!"
Candace," Oh, hi, Stacy."
Stacy, And I also want a car!
Phineas," I still can't believe Perry wanted us to go home. I mean, look at this!"
Reporter, There's robots all over the Tri-State Area! And now for the weather.
Weatherman," There's robots, Phil! ROBOTS! (he screams and runs)"
Phineas," You'd think he'd need all the help he can ge-- (He hears a beeping sound) Hey, what's that? Ferb, do you hear that?"
Computer," (Female voice) Welcome, Phineas and Ferb. Please insert the key."
Phineas, (to Ferb) Do you have a key? (Ferb takes out a pitch pipe and blows a note)
Computer, Please insert the key.
Phineas, Good try.
Computer," Please insert the key. Please insert the key. (it points down, showing a keyhole shaped like Perry's unfolded locket)"
Phineas, That's odd. It's a shaped keyhole. It kinda looks like—wait a minute!
Computer," Phineas and Ferb, this message is top secret, for your ears only. If you're hearing this, the Tri-State Area is at an emergency alert level Alpha Red. Agent P needs your help."
Phineas, How does he know we'll know what to do?
Computer," He knows you will know what to do. He also knows you are the only ones capable of helping him, because you two are the only ones capable of creating these."
Voice, Auto scan replication initiated.
Phineas," Ferb, I think I know what we're gonna do today!"
Normbots, You have a new leader. Put on your Dooferalls.
Normbot, 36 inch waist.
Phineas," So, I guess you trusted us after all. (Perry smiles)"
Baljeet," Oh, I was wrong, it was not for me!"
Buford," Heads up, platy-posterior coming through!"
Candace, Now this is what I call busting!
Phineas," Alright, everyone! Let's kick some robot chassis!"
Buford, Yeah!
Baljeet, Alright! That is very good!
Isabella, Yay!
Danny, Phineas! Anything we can do?
Phineas, Yeah! Musical accompaniment!
Song, Robot Riot)
Isabella, Yes!
Phineas, We gotta do something about that portal!
Phineas," Ferb, we're going to try and stop the portal!"
Candace," I was wrong, Stacy, about everything. I'm not a grown-up. I can't control mysterious forces. I can't even get my mom to see what my brothers are doing! (she smiles) Stacy, that's it! I can't get my mom to see what my brothers are doing! (she runs off)"
Stacy," Candace, where are you going?"
Candace, I'm gonna bust my brothers to my mom! And I'm gonna fail!
DEI," Doofenshmirtz is still at the front door, talking to Mrs. Thompson on the intercom)"
Doofenshmirtz," No, it's Heinz Doofenshmirtz. You borrowed sugar from me this morning!"
 Thompson, I don't have any sugar. I had to borrow some from my neighbor this morning.
Doofenshmirtz," Yeah, that's me. That's..."
 Thompson," Oh, he's a nice man, but I hear he's divorced."
Doofenshmirtz," Oh, THAT she remembers."
Candace," Psst, mom!"
Linda," Candace, what are you doing here?"
Candace, You've got to come outside and bust the boys!
Linda, I'm not leaving now. The girl is about to forgive the guy for the clichéd misunderstanding... (a Normbot tears through the screen) After she battles these robots.
Lawrence," Whoa, this 3-D is amazing!"
Isabella," Ferb, we'll handle things down here! (she fires, hitting a bot) Go help Phineas!"
Phineas," Oh, so that dish must be what's controlling the robots! Maybe I don't need to close the portal if I can just take out that... (he sees the baseball launcher) Oh, yeah!"
 Try saying that five times fast," boyborg, boyborg, boyborg, boyborg, boyborg, boyborg... eh, I guess its not that hard. Never mind."
Isabella," It's weird that Perry's a secret agent, huh?"
Buford," Yeah, but it was obvious in retrospect."
Baljeet, Has anyone seen my pants?
Buford," Yeah, they're over there."
Irving, WOLVERINES!
Candace," Mom, if you care one iota about me, your family, and your city, you'll come outside with me right now!"
Linda," Well, I guess I could use some more popcorn."
Candace," Great! (she pulls her out) Come on, come on, come on, come on!"
Phineas," Ferb, bro! I just hit the best home run ever!"
Doofenshmirtz, Hey!
Doofenshmirtz, I got a little something just for you...
Doofenshmirtz," Yeah, it's mine. See, I told you I never lost it. It was in a box in my pantry labeled ""VHS Tapes"". Go figure. Anyway, you can have it."
Doofenshmirtz," Eh, it's the least I can do."
Doofenshmirtz," Aw, you."
Candace," Come on, come on, come on! Come on, hurry! Hurry! (she motions for her to look)"
Linda, Do I even need to say there's nothing there anymore?
Candace," Mom, you can say it all you want! (hugs her and does a little dance) There's nothing there! Woo hoo! I did it! I saved the world! (she stops and smiles, pause) You can go back to your movie now."
Candace," Hey, did you guys just see that? I saved Danville!"
Candace," So, what will you do now?"
Candace," Well, I know what interests I'd pursue. (she points to 2nd Dimension Jeremy as he comes out of the portal)"
Candace," You know, after all of this, I'm gonna to give myself a little more time to be young. It's not such a bad place to be."
Phineas, Uh-oh.
Phineas, Sorry he's mostly made of metal now.
Phineas, I'm glad we could help.
Phineas," Man, this was the greatest day ever. Imagine how much fun we can have together now that we know you're a secret agent!"
Major Monogram," Yes yes, the next 15 minutes should be a real hoot. Then, of course, Agent P will be sent away forever."
Phineas, What?
Major Monogram, You didn't know? Didn't he give you a pamphlet?
Phineas, We threw it away.
Major Monogram, Does anyone read those things?
Carl," I tried to warn you, sir."
Major Monogram," Kids, I'm sorry, but now that Agent P's cover has been blown, you won't be allowed to see him anymore."
Phineas, That's why you didn't want us to know your secret. (Perry nods) So we'll never see Perry again? There has to be another way!
Major Monogram," Sorry, Phineas. It isn't safe, you know too much."
Phineas, Now I never wished so much that I could un-know something.
Carl," Sir, maybe there is a way. What about Dr. Doofenshmirtz's Amnesia-nator?"
Doofenshmirtz, I never built an Amnesia-nator. I think I'd remember building something like that.
Major Monogram," Well, that might work, but you'd all have to agree."
Phineas," So our choice is to: either forget the best day ever, forget the greatest adventure we've ever had, and forget meeting Agent P, or remember today, but never see Perry again?"
Ferb," Well, we've had a lot of great days, but we only have one Perry."
Phineas, Agreed.
All, Yeah.
Major Monogram," (from inside) Alright, everybody, tall kids in the back. (zooms to the inside of the lab) Just need to do a little more programming here, and we'll be ready to roll."
Phineas," Hey, buddy. Ferb and I just wanted to say our goodbyes. You know, we thought we'd met the real you when we found out you were Agent P. But the fact is, pet, secret agent, they're both the real you. You are now, and always have been a great pet, and a great friend. We're going to miss you, Agent P. (Perry hugs Ferb, then hugs Phineas) I love you, pal."
Carl," Sir, are you crying?"
Major Monogram," No, I'm sweating through my eyes."
Phineas," Okay, sir, we're ready. (They walk back. Perry walks up to Major Monogram.)"
Major Monogram," Okay, Carl, we're all set."
Isabella," Uh, Major Monogram?"
Major Monogram," (offscreen) Uh, yes?"
Isabella," So, none of us will remember any of today?"
Major Monogram, That's right.
Isabella," (firmly) Good. (she grabs him and kisses him right on the lips, Phineas gasps)"
Phineas, (surprised) Isabella!
Isabella," Hit it, Carl!"
Phineas, Wait! Wait! Wait!
